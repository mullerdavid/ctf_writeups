# Dan's Secret

Our trade secret flag has been stolen once again, even though we disabled directory listing. What leaked it this time?

> Remarks from the creator:
> * The flag is in 3 parts: CQ24{part1_part2_part3}. All parts are separated by an underscore _ and they already contain all required underscores. You just have to put them together
> * the challenge uses one port.


**Flag format**: `CQ24{...}`
