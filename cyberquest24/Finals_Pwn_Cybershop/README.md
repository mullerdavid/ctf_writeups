# Cybershop

Are you as much of a retro enthusiast as I am? Nowadays, setting up an online shop is a breeze with platforms like Shopify, WordPress plugins, and Drupal. But letâ€™s be realâ€”true craftsmen code their own solutions. And letâ€™s not forget: real coders avoid interpreted languages. I trust you've picked up on that by now! ðŸ“ˆ

And really, whatâ€™s the point of grinding away at CTF competitions when you can just buy your way to the prizes? Ladies and gentlemen, introducing our revolutionary conceptâ€”welcome to the Cybershop!
