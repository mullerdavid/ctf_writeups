# Secret Gallery

Imagine an app that's not just another gallery—it's your personal, secret vault. Finally, a place to store pics of bills, recipes, or whatever else, without worrying about them leaking. Strangely, other gallery apps like Xiaomi's just hide files under `/sdcard/Android/data`, renaming them without extensions. What’s the point of that?! Anyone can simply add `.png` and—boom—your private stuff is exposed. And Google Photos? Sure, it has a "locked" folder with fingerprint/PIN protection, but then it uploads your images unencrypted? Seriously?

But now, that all changes! Our app delivers a clean, straightforward solution with military-grade encryption. Your files stay truly secure—no compromises. To prove it, our CEO went all-in and leaked his own gallery backup containing top company secrets. If that gets cracked, we’re done. That’s how much we trust our solution.
