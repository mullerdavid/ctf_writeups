# Base64

There was basically nothing given. Converting the message `fWZsQl9JbHVfYkg0dl9sMGdfaDRkX2cxezQySlgK` from base64 results in the `}flB_Ilu_bH4v_l0g_h4d_g1{42JX`, which looks really similar to the flag format, but reversed.

# Reverse

Reversing it results in `XJ24{1g_d4h_g0l_v4Hb_ulI_Blf}`. 

# Substitution ciphers

There is not a big sample size, therefore it is probably some known algo, like Caesar or Vigen√®re. Using the known flag format as crib helps identifying the algo and the key possibly. After iterating through the [common ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher#External_links), Atbash gives a good decryption.
