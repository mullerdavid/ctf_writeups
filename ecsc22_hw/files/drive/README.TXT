=== To all survivors ===

If you're reading this, it means that we have succeeded against all odds in preserving mankind's most important knowledge for those who come after us.
Unfortunately, it also means that as we expected society as we know it has collapsed. We've had it a long time coming, I'm afraid.

The four Knowledge Vault modules attached to this device contain some critical blueprints that are needed to revive a global civilisation. To keep this information out of the hands of malicious parties, vault contents are protected from access by security measures running on a separate TPM chip.

We hope with all might that you succeed in unlocking all vaults, and give mankind a second chance to thrive.
