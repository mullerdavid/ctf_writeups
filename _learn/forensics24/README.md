# Forensics Excercise

This is a simulated forensics analysis with 2 loosely connected parts that should be completed in order.

The source for the malware can be found in [src/src.zip](src/src.zip) (pw: infected), but don't use it if you want to solve the challenges.

# Remarks

Please be careful with the malwares. They have some safeguards, but make sure you are handling them in a safe environment to prevent any damage.
