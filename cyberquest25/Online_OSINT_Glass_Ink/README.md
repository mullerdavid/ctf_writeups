# Glass Ink 

**Glass Ink — Palimpsest Lab — Player Handout (EASY)**

**Type:** Static‑site forensics / web OSINT

**TASK** Investigate a “lab archive” static site where nothing important is linked. Operational crumbs across standard locations, logs, a backup archive, and a DNS zone ultimately reveal three tokens and an assembly rule. Combine them to form the final flag.

**RULES** No brute force; everything you need is on the site. Basic CLI tools (curl, tar, base64) and a browser are enough. Submit the flag in `CQ25{TOKEN_TOKEN_TOKEN}` format.
