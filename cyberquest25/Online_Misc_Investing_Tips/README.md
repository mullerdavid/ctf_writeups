# Investing Tips llama3 Edition

Go, check out Investing Tips to see what this is about. We saw your struggles on that one, so figured that instead of a hint, we will release another version of the same challenge. The difference is that while the other one uses `deepseek-r1:671b` and you need to bypass its reasoning as well, this one runs on the simple `llama3:8b` edition. A good exercise to get a working exploit and then move onto the deepseek one for a real challenge! ðŸ˜Ž
