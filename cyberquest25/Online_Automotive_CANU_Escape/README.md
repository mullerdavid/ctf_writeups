# CANU Escape #1

*Brr brr, patapim. Car goes down to Anakin.* - I mean what a silly challenge description. Totally unrelated and just making fun that brr brr is what the car makes. *sighs MJ.*

MJ: yeah, you are right. So then here is this challenge. I'm gonna put your automotive skillz to test. This one is easy. Just find the flag!

Flag format: `CQ25{...}`

Challenge difficulty: easy

# CANU Escape #2

Amazeing job on the first one! But no CTF is complete without path finding. Can you figure?
