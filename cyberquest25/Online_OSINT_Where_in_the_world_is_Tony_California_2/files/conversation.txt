Hey, they almost got me in Germany. Pheew that was close, but we definitely have to be more careful next time.
[???]
Maybe they somehow got hold of our last conversation and figured it out.
[T.C.]
Could be. Anyway just got to the place.
[???]
How many hours this time?
[T.C.]
Around 15 give or take but atleast no trains this time.
[???]
Seems like those trains got on your nerves.
[T.C.]
Haha funny...  At least it's better than in Wilhelmshaven
[???]
Oh really, maybe we have to move the drop offs to mostly outside of europe then. Could be cost effective haha.
[T.C.]
Yeah, only problem is that I can't speak this language, even though I know some mandarin it's useless here.
[???]
Yeah they have really weird symbols, but atleast the soup is good/cheap so take what you get.
[T.C.]
Shut up.... but true, I stand out a bit too much with my height plus I preferred the german girls, some of them here seem like they have male-ish faces
[???]
Anywaaay, the meeting place is enclosed by the river, the palace, a medical school and a museum you can't really miss it. Are you in the area? Where are you staying?
[T.C.]
Yeah, I think I'm quite close to it. Should be walking distance, I directly next to the royal pavillon.
[???]
Great, it's settled then. Maybe if you want to be a bit more out of sight go to the nearest metro station and circle around. The less time you spend above ground it's less likely for people to spot you.
[T.C.]
Will do, meet you there!
