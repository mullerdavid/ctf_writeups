# Service discovery

[Scanning](../Scans/WRITEUP.md) the 10.10.x.12 machines reveals a TCP service at port 49428 with some math question.

Using netcat is enough to access the service.

```bash
nc -v 10.10.1.12 49428
```

# Math

We need positive integers `x`, `y`, `z` to satisfy the `x/(y+z) + y/(x+z) + z/(x+y) = 10` equation.

Notice that multiplying all the numbers with the same number (eg 10) doesn't change the left side.

# Source

Checking the [main.go](workdir/main.go) source reveals that there is a shortcut. 

```go
four := new(big.Float).SetFloat64(10)
tolerance := new(big.Float).SetFloat64(1e-10) // that's 0.0000000001, so should be okay
diff := new(big.Float).Sub(sum, four)
absDiff := new(big.Float).Abs(diff)
if absDiff.Cmp(tolerance) < 0 {
    fmt.Fprint(conn, flagText)
} else {
    resultStr := sum.Text('f', 15)
    fmt.Fprintf(conn, "Nope, that was not the correct answer. The correct answer was 10, but you supplied ~%s\n", resultStr)
    log.Printf("Incorrect answer: %s", resultStr)
}
```

The left side being close enough to 10 can satisfy the check, instead being exactly 10.

```
abs(x/(y+z) + y/(x+z) + z/(x+y) - 10) < 0.0000000001
```

# WolframAlpha

Using [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) to solve the problem. We can fix 2 of the variables, just make sure they are not equal to make it easier. `x=1, y=16` was chosen.

```
abs(x/(y+z) + y/(x+z) + z/(x+y) - 10), x=1, y=16
```

Clicking on the bottom right format also making some plots, where `z` is visibly touching `0`.

```
abs(-10 + z/17 + 16/(1 + z) + 1/(16 + z))
```

![](screenshots/4.png)

Upon closer inspection for the minimum point and using the plain text as next step.

```
abs(-10 + z/17 + 16/(1 + z) + 1/(16 + z)) minimum where z in [165,175]
```

The first digits of our number can be extracted.

```
50 digits of {z -> 51 + (2 (222462 + (5 I) Sqrt[122253963])^(1/3))/3^(2/3) + 5194/(3 (222462 + (5 I) Sqrt[122253963]))^(1/3)}
```

![](screenshots/7.png)

```
{z->168.30115515314342741576785106824772455417473325055 + 0.Ã—10^-47 i}
```

# Giving the numbers

Using the `z` calculated with the fixed `x` and `y` reveals the flag with some extra credit. All we need to do is multiply them, so they are integers and not floats. Multiplying them with 10000000000 satisfies the condition.

```
Enter the value for x: 10000000000
Enter the value for y: 160000000000
Enter the value for z: 1683011551530
```
