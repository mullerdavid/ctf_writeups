# Info

This repository is an archive of some of the cyber security games. Some of them have detailed writeups included. Check the folders for details.

# Malware

None of the files are supposed to be active malwares, but some Anti Virus solutions can alert on certain patterns.

To prevent these false positive triggers, some files are zipped with password `infected`.
