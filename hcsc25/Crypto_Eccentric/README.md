# Eccentric

Alice and Bob are a weird duo every time I want to listen in on their conversation they always use some cryptographic algorithm to lock me out. But this time I have the upper hand, I know Alice's secret is 1144 and Bob's is 2166. In the curve a is 1234, b is 5678 and p is 8837. Can you find out their shared secret and return it to me? :D

Ohh and I almost forgot G is (299, 6040)

Note: The flag is the shared secret's x coordinate hashed with SHA1

Flag format: `HCSC{<flag>}` where flag is the shared secret hashed with SHA1
