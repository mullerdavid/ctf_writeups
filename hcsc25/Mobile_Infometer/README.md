# Infometer

Welcome to Infometer - the app that claims to measure the reliability of information. Because who doesn’t love trusting an app with their deepest thoughts? But hey, maybe it’s more than just an overconfident calculator. Some say it can be used to find the truth... or at least something pretending to be it.
