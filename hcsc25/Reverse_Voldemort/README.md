# Voldemort

This challange invites you to channel your inner Hermione and uncover a hidden flag buried within layers of obfuscation. This isn't about the infamous Voldemort malware, but you might notice some similarities. Your mission is to uncover the right spells and cast them in the correct sequence to unlock the flag.

The password that gets you started: `dobbyHasNoMaster!`

Note: Might be malicious. If you plan to run this, we definitely recommend a throwaway VM.

Good luck! May your magic be powerful and your logic razor-sharp! Happy flag hunting!
