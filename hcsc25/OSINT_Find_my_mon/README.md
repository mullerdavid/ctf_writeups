📘 Find My Mom – OSINT CTF Game Help

Welcome, Agent!

Your mission is to help Hanna find her mother. She got separated and only has a few clues to share with you. The game is a light OSINT challenge – you’ll need to investigate online using hints she gives you.

🧩 Gameplay Instructions:

1. The game starts with Hanna speaking to you.
1. Use the arrow buttons to navigate through her messages.
1. Once she gives you a riddle or clue, search online (Google may help 😉).
1. When you find the correct keyword or location, enter it into the input field.
1. If the answer is correct, the story will continue.

🔐 Hints:

- The first clue is related to a geolocation service.
- Use the poem lines carefully — they point toward a specific service that uses 3 words.
- Look up the poem phrase online to find the exact location or code.
- The answer format is case sensitive, no spaces.

🎯 Goal:

The game ends when you help Hanna find her mom. If you're successful, you'll see a final message — but the actual flag is something you need to deduce or gather from the full journey.

Flag format: *HCSC25{...}*

Good luck, detective. 🌐🔍
