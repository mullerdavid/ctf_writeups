# Capture me if you can #1

Supercomputers are advancing at an astonishing pace, and our team of security researchers has been hard at work exploring post-quantum cryptography. We even developed a proof of concept—until recent layoffs derailed our progress (we had to kick out Jack) and it never made it into production. Now, we don't even know how to communicate with these experimental services. It all feels like complete gibberish. If you can cut through the confusion and solve the challenge, you’ll earn a special reward: the flag. Good luck!
